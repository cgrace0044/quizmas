## Design and Colour Scheme

The imagery and colour scheme of the site were both given careful consideration to ensure they compliment each other. The imagery used in the game is very important to the overall experience of the user.

- Given that the game will be predominently played over Christmas 2023, Christmas colours were chosen.
